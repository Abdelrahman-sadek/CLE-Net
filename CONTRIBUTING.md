- **Architecture discussions**: Propose changes to the core design
- **Code contributions**: Implement features, fix bugs, optimize performance
- **Documentation**: Improve docs, write examples, create tutorials
- **Research**: Contribute to whitepapers, threat models, economic analysis
- **Testing**: Write tests, improve coverage, verify behavior
- **Feedback**: Open issues with critiques, suggestions, and concerns

### Current Priority Areas 🎯

- **Phase 3: Cognitive Enhancement**
  - Rule evolution and decay mechanisms
  - Contradiction resolution protocols
  - Context-aware rule validation
  - Knowledge graph optimization
  
- **Multi-Modal Processing**
  - Production-grade speech-to-text integration (Whisper, etc.)
  - OCR improvements (Tesseract, cloud OCR)
  - Object detection models (YOLO, etc.)
  - Full-duplex interaction optimization
  
- **Symbolic Regression**
  - Advanced GP operators and mutations
  - Bayesian optimization integration
  - Uncertainty quantification improvements
  
- **Testing & Validation**
  - Unit tests for new modules
  - Integration tests for P2P network
  - Performance benchmarks
  - Security audits

## 📋 Contribution Guidelines

### 1. Start with Discussion

Before writing code or making significant changes:

1. Check existing issues and discussions
2. Open a new issue to describe your proposed change
3. Discuss the approach with maintainers
4. Get agreement before implementing

### 2. Fork and Clone

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/cle-net.git
cd cle-net
```

### 3. Create a Feature Branch

```bash
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
```

### 4. Make Changes

Follow these coding standards:

- **Python**: PEP 8, type hints required
- **Documentation**: Markdown, clear explanations
- **Tests**: Required for new features
- **Commits**: Descriptive messages, reference issues

### 5. Submit a Pull Request

1. Push your branch to your fork
2. Open a PR against the main repository
3. Describe your changes clearly
4. Link related issues
5. Respond to feedback

## 🧠 Architecture Contributions

CLE-Net is an architecture-first project. When contributing to the core design:
