# Frequently Asked Questions

## 🤔 What is CLE-Net?

CLE-Net stands for **Decentralized Cognitive Agent Network**. It's an experimental architecture for AI agents that:

1. Extract symbolic laws from human interaction
2. Discover latent rules through symbolic regression
3. Persist knowledge across a decentralized network
4. Survive failures through distributed coordination

In short: CLE-Net turns conversations into cognitive laws.

## 🧠 What does CLE stand for?

**CLE = Cognitive Logic Extraction**

It refers to the process of converting unstructured human interaction (text, voice, documents) into symbolic representations and discovering the implicit rules that govern behavior.

---

## 🌐 Why a decentralized network?

Centralized AI systems have fundamental weaknesses:

- Single point of failure
- Dependent on operators
- Vulnerable to shutdowns
- Controlled by entities

CLE-Net distributes cognition so that:

- No single node controls memory
- The system survives individual failures
- Knowledge persists across machines and time
- No single entity can kill the network

---

## 🔑 What is Proof of Cognition (PoC)?

Proof of Cognition is CLE-Net's consensus mechanism. It replaces:

- **PoW**: Energy-heavy computations
- **PoS**: Capital-based voting

With:

**Independent cognitive discovery**

A rule achieves consensus when multiple independent agents, operating on different data, converge on the same symbolic rule. Truth emerges from independent reasoning, not authority or energy expenditure.

## 🤖 How is this different from AI agents?

| Aspect | Traditional AI Agents | CLE-Net |
|--------|----------------------|---------|
| Focus | Answer questions | Discover laws |
| Memory | Local/context | Distributed/persistent |
| Reasoning | Statistical | Symbolic + statistical |
| Control | Centralized | Decentralized |
| Evolution | Model updates | Law evolution |

CLE-Net is not a chatbot or task executor. It's cognitive infrastructure.

## ⚖️ Is CLE-Net a blockchain?

CLE-Net uses blockchain concepts but is not a blockchain in the traditional sense.

**CLE-Net uses blockchain for:**

- State persistence
- Consensus coordination
- Incentive mechanisms

**CLE-Net does NOT:**

- Focus on financial transactions
- Require proof-of-work
- Depend on specific chain (platform-agnostic)

---

## 🎯 What is the economic model?

Still being designed. Current concepts:

- **Mining = Thinking**: Nodes earn rewards for discovering useful rules
- **Rule stability**: Rules that survive longer earn more
- **Simplicity bonus**: Simple, general rules preferred

Exact mechanisms require more research and community input.

---

## 🔒 How secure is CLE-Net?

CLE-Net has an explicit threat model (see [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md)):

**Protected against:**
- Single malicious agents
- Rule spam
- Some Sybil attacks
- Data leakage (through hashing)

**Limitations:**
- Coordinated collusion may temporarily bias rules
- Global shutdown kills everything (physics)
- Economic model is experimental

Honest limitations are documented in `/docs/architecture/threat_model.md`.

---

## 🚫 What can't CLE-Net do?

- Guarantee absolute truth
- Prevent all manipulation
- Replace human judgment
- Operate without any nodes
- Provide guaranteed privacy

---

## 🎓 Is this academic or practical?

Both. CLE-Net is:

- **Research-driven**: Exploring new concepts in AI and distributed systems
- **Engineering-focused**: Building actual working systems
- **Open-source**: All findings shared publicly

---

## 💻 Can I run CLE-Net now?

Yes! CLE-Net has completed Phases 1-2 and is now in Phase 3.

## 🎤 Why the name "CLE-Net"?

**CLE** = Cognitive Logic Extraction
**Net** = Network / Decentralization

The name reflects the core innovation: extracting symbolic logic from human interaction and persisting it across a decentralized network.

---

## ⚠️ Is this for illegal use?

**No.** CLE-Net is designed for:

- Research
- Legitimate knowledge discovery
- Educational purposes
- Organizational policy analysis

Any use for surveillance, control, or harm is explicitly prohibited and against the project's values.
