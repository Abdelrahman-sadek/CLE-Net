# CLE-Net Governance: Decision Process

This document outlines how decisions are made in CLE-Net.

---

## 1. Governance Philosophy

CLE-Net is designed with minimal governance:

- **Code governs**: Protocol rules are enforced mechanically
- **Transparency**: All decisions are visible and challengeable
- **Gradual evolution**: Changes require broad consensus

---

## 2. Decision Categories

### 2.1 Protocol Parameters

| Parameter | Governance | Example |
|-----------|-------------|---------|
| Threshold values | Hardcoded initially | MIN_AGENTS = 3 |
| Weights | Upgradeable | CCS weights |
| Time windows | Upgradeable | Stability period |

### 2.2 Core Principles

Immutable (cannot change):

- Proof of Cognition mechanism
- No deletion of laws
- Independence requirements

Upgradable (can change via governance):

- Threshold values
- Weight configurations
- New validation rules

---

## 3. Governance Process

### Phase 1: Proposal

Any community member can propose changes:

1. Create a proposal issue
2. Describe the change and rationale
3. Provide technical analysis
4. Gather initial feedback

### Phase 2: Discussion

Period for community discussion:

- 2 weeks minimum
- Technical merits debated
- Edge cases identified
- Alternatives proposed

### Phase 3: Validation

Proposal undergoes technical review:

- Security analysis
- Performance impact
- Backward compatibility
- Economic effects

### Phase 4: Decision

Community votes:

- Qualified stakeholders (high CCS + stake)
- Super-majority required (67%)
- Quorum required (50% participation)

### Phase 5: Implementation

If approved:

- Code changes implemented
- Tested thoroughly
- De path
- Monitorployed with migrationed for issues

---

## 4. Emergency Decisions

For urgent security issues:

1. **Core team** can make immediate parameter changes
2. **Community** must ratify within 30 days
3. **Transparency** required: all actions documented

---

## 5. Conflict Resolution Governance

Special process for conflict resolution algorithm changes:

1. Requires 80% super-majority
2. Must include formal proof of correctness
3. Backward compatibility preferred
4. Gradual rollout with old algorithm

---

## 6. Contributor Roles

| Role | Responsibilities |
|------|------------------|
| Core Developers | Implement changes |
| Researchers | Propose improvements |
| Validators | Test and validate |
| Community | Discuss and vote |

---

## 7. Transparency Requirements

All governance decisions must be:

- Publicly documented
- Reasoned explicitly
- Vote results recorded
- Implementation tracked
